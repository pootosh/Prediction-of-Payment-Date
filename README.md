# Prediction-of-Payment-Date
A csv invoice_details file have invoices dataset that contains the past payment information and
behaviour of various buyers. Based on the previous payment patterns, the ML model needs to
predict what will be the date a payment is made by the customer for an invoice.
The model also needs to predict which aging bucket the invoice falls into based on the
predicted payment date.

The objective is:
● To build a Machine Learning Model to predict the payment date of an invoice when it
gets created in the system.
● Categorize the invoice into different buckets based on predicted payment date .
